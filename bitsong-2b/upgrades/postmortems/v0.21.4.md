## After The Upgrade Report: v0.21.4

## What Happened?

## Immediate Consensus Afer Graceful Halt

Upon reaching the halt height, any node that did not gracefully halt to apply the patch as instructed through the upgrade guide began the consensus rounds prevotes,as normally expected. 
Due to this upgrade not actually containing any consensus breaking logic (not regarding moving the wasm data path), once nodes that did gracefully halt, applied the wasm data path correction, and upgraded to the latest version of go-bitsong,
consensus was able to be met essentially immediately after reaching the halt height. 


## App Hash Triggered By Cosmwasm Execution

Once consensus was resumed, it was confirmed that the bug present with cosmwasm stateful queries was resolved, and a transaction calling a cosmwasm contract was submitted by the core team,
resulting in an app-hash difference between nodes that did not perform all of the patch steps as necessary, and those that did. Nodes that did not have the correct final app hash were required to use a snapshot prior to the halt height, and reapply the coordinated patch as expected to end up with the correct app hash. This took some time for the majority of nodes to agree on the finalized app hash, & upon reaching 2/3 majority consensus, the block was committed and we resumed block creation as epected.
